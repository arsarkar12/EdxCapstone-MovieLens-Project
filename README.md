HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science - Capstone MovieLens Project for modelling a Movie Recommendation System

This repository showcases the implementation of the first capstone project in the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate program. The project focuses on building an algorithm to develop a movie recommendation system leveraging the MovieLens 10M dataset. The objective is to predict user ratings for movies with a Residual Mean Square Error (RMSE) below the benchmark of 0.86490, a standard set by the project guidelines.

The recommendation system employs data science techniques such as exploratory data analysis, data wrangling, and predictive modeling. Using the MovieLens dataset, the project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to data preparation, algorithm development, and performance evaluation to meet the defined RMSE target.
